    // -> but in these case we are not making the object but also the program is running
    // -> it is possible because we are using static keyword in the main function
    // -> in these case void is saying that after function call value will not return
    // -> in here public is the access modifier which is saying that this method in this class can be able to access from any where
    // -> static mean that we can call this function without making an object
